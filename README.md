# Reinforcement Learning

This repo contains the implementations of the RL algorithms in GridWorld and a variety of openAI domains.

## Folders

The folder structures are broken down as follows:

### Initial_experiments_and_misc
This contains code that is used when experimenting with new ideas, implementing state of the art and is not considered clean code.
However, it is kept as a reminder of the process.

### RL_for_gridworld
This folder contains the implementations of Monte Carlo, TD, SARSA, Q-Learning, and Policy Gradient to learn the optimum path in the
gridworld.
